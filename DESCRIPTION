Description: Tools for analysing non-verbal communication by processing 
    data extracted from video recordings of dyadic interactions. It supports 
    integration with open source tools, currently limited to OpenPose, 
    converting its outputs into CSV format for further analysis. The package 
    includes functions for data pre-processing, visualization, and computation 
    of motion indices such as velocity, acceleration, and jerkiness. These 
    tools facilitate the analysis of non-verbal cues in paired interactions, 
    contributing to research on human communication dynamics.
