Description: This R package facilitates researchers in analysing
    non-verbal communication by processing data extracted from video
    recordings of dyadic interactions. It supports integration with open
    source tools. Currently, limited to OpenPose converting its outputs
    into CSV format for further analysis. The package includes functions
    for data pre-processing, visualization, and computation of key motion
    indices such as velocity, acceleration, and jerkiness. By streamlining
    these tasks, the package enables efficient and effective analysis of
    non-verbal cues in paired interactions, aiding in a deeper
    understanding of human communication dynamics.
