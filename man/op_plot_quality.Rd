\title{Plot Data Quality (Confidence Ratings or Completeness)}
\usage{
op_plot_quality(df, plot_type = "confidence", threshold_line = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing the confidence data, with columns for base_filename, region, person, and confidence values.}

\item{plot_type}{Character. Either "confidence" to plot the mean confidence rating, "completeness" to plot the percentage of completeness, or "both" to plot both.
Default is "confidence".}

\item{threshold_line}{Numeric. The value at which to draw a dashed horizontal line. Default is 50.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object or a combined plot if "both" is selected.
}

or both for the given dataframe. It can handle data for one or multiple persons and regions, creating separate panels for each.

# Example usage:
# df <- read.csv("path_to_your_data.csv")
